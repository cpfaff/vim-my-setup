My Vim setup
============

This repository contains my personal Vim setup. It contains a very detaild
configuration and a curated set of plug-ins that play well together. The plugin
packages are managed via the
[NeoBundle](https://github.com/Shougo/neobundle.vim.git) package manager for
VIM.


Install with script:

```
wget https://raw.github.com/cpfaff/vim-my-setup/master/install.sh
```

```
chmod +x install.sh
```

```
./install.sh
```
