My Vim setup
============

This repository contains my personal Vim setup which can be installed manually
or with a bash installer script. The setup contains a curated set of plug-ins
that play well together. The packages are managed with the Vim package manager
[NeoBundle](https://github.com/Shougo/neobundle.vim.git).

The installer:

```
wget https://raw.github.com/cpfaff/vim-my-setup/master/install.sh
```

```
chmod +x install.sh
```

```
./install.sh
```
